# Assignment 01

## Brief 
Starting from the concept of a pinboard, implement a web page that:

- is responsive (properly layout for smartphone, tablet, and desktop)
- allows the user to add and remove elements
- allows the user to coustomize elements (i.e. colors, size)
- allows the switch between two views (at least)

## Project Description
This responsive web page allows the user to change from Light to Dark Mode, as well as change the view from row to column on dekstop screens (because the responsive layout changes automatically to column view for smaller screen to improve responsiveness).

Users can also remove the image of the game and add it again using buttons.

Users are also allowed to add their own rating to each game. The rating is then showcased on the page.
