# Assignment 02

## Brief 
Choose a “mini-game” to rebuild with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The requirements are:

    - The webpage should be responsive
    - Choose an avatar at the beginning of the game
    - Keep track of the score of the player
    - Use the keyboard to control the game (indicate what are the controls in the page). You can also use buttons (mouse), but also keyboard.
    - Use some multimedia files (audio, video, …)
    - Implement an “automatic restart” in the game (that is not done via the refresh of the page)
