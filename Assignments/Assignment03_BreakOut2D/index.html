            <h2>How to play</h2>
            <p>Destroy all bricks to win the game!</p>
            <p>Use your left and right arrow keys to move the paddle on the bottom of the playground in order to catch the moving ball before it its the ground and to direct it towards the bricks.</p>
            <p>If the ball hits the floor, you will lose one life, but will still be able to keep on playing until you loose all lives. Once you have lost all lives, the game ends and you can start again by clicking on the START GAME button.</p>   
            <p>When you win levels, the game gets progressively more difficult, since the paddle shrinks and the ball movement speeds up after each level win.</p>
