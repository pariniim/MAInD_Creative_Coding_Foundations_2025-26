# Assignment 02

## Brief 
Choose a “mini-game” to rebuild with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The requirements are:

    - The webpage should be responsive
    - Choose an avatar at the beginning of the game
    - Keep track of the score of the player
    - Use the keyboard to control the game (indicate what are the controls in the page). You can also use buttons (mouse), but also keyboard.
    - Use some multimedia files (audio, video, …)
    - Implement an “automatic restart” in the game (that is not done via the refresh of the page)

## Project Description
The goal of this short game is to destroy all the blue bricks with the pink ball by letting it bounce off the paddle and walls. 

The game keeps track of the score, which increases according to how many bricks have been destroyed. 

The user can control the green paddle using the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle to the left and to the right, respectively. 

Each time the ball touches the floor, the player loses one life. Once the lives are depleted, the game is over.
